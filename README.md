# Quantum Metric Business Pulse Dashboard Block

## What does this Looker Block do for me?

Use the Quantum Metric Business Pulse Dashboard Block to ensure greater visibility of your ??? data throughout your organization. Use Lookerâ€™s interface and tools to create custom alerts, see trends over time, or merge your ??? data with data from other ??? for deeper analysis. A sample of the analysis in this block includes:


* **Visualize your Digital Product's Performance -** Immediate and granular insights into the overall performance and underlying factors and behaviors influencing business outcomes.

* **Centralize your customer data -** Break down data silos by consolidating insights around technical performance, UX behaviors and revenue in one place

* **Server Log Analysis:**
-     Funnel Performance - Identify which steps in your funnel are driving drop-off and build cohorts and segments to better diagnose root cause
-     Revenue/AOV/Business Impact - Pull in your Quantum Metric definition of revenue or business impact to place a dollar value on insights
-     Engagement Time/Scroll Depth - Go beyond vanity metrics like Time-On-Page to understand how and where users actually spend their time engaging
-     Error Occurrences - Identify errors, both those visible to the client as well as those occurring behind the scenes and understand impact on KPIs
-     Page Performance - Identify slow-loading pages or steps within a single-page app and understand impact on conversion


## How to implement this Block

Create a connection to your BigQuery database on your Looker instance. ??? How do I know if I have the correct data loaded into my BigQuery database to support this block?

Download the LookML files and drag them into your LookML project, or copy and paste the text.

Rename the `connection_name`, `schema_name` and `organization_name` constants in the manifest file (`manifest.lkml`) to match your environment.
